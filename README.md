# Dante-Stars
Dante Stars is a first year EPITECH project for the second semester in the "Elementary programming in C" category. The goal is to program an algorithm which makes it possible to generate a labyrinth (perfect or imperfect) as well as to solve it.  Algorithm used for the generation: Binary three  Algorithm used for the resolution: DFS (algorithm realized by my comrade Arnaud Ho).
